Compared with privacy coins such as Monero, ZCash, Dash, AOS allows users to issue their own confidential assets and has achieved Turing complete as for the issuance of confidential assets. In comparison to other smart contract platforms that protect privacy, AOS has made an invention in zero-knowledge-proof programming and has achieved Turing completion in privacy application programming.
